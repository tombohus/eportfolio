										<h2>Learning Outcomes and Skills Gained</h2>
									</header>
                  <p> While the full list of the skills I have gained is present in the final reflective piece, here are some of the most important outcomes that I will keep using after this module: <br><br> Time Management - While dealing with the assignment on its own can be stressful, it is especially stressful when you do not know what to expect from your team members. Time management becamse an essential part of my day to day university studies, as a result of the experience I've had in our group. By prioritizing certain tasks and setting timelines and milestones, I was able to benchmark the success of the assignments, before they were actually finished. <br><br> Problem Solving - while the problems contained within the assignment were challenging, there was enough documentation available to compare different risk modelling techniques, as well as find one that is the most suitable technique for supply chain challenges. This fact, combined with the ability to distribute tasks efficiently allows me to set expectations and have a best-case/worst-case scenario in my mind, without causing unneccesary stress within the team. <br><br> Interpersonal Skills - By having to work with different team members from different time zones and backgrounds, we had to create a common set of expectations and approaches, so the final summary can be presented back to the tutor. By being able to compromise and communicate, we were able to identify issues and lack of participation early on, allowing us to adjust the student plan and the contract accordingly. <br><br> Of course, all of these skills are complemented by the number of new topics I have learned about information security, risk management, risk modelling techniques, qualitative and quantitative analysis, as well as disaster recovery and business continuity.</p>
