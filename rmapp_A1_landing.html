Introduction <br><br>

Cybersecurity in the transportation sector is a critical aspect of protecting the safety, reliability, and integrity of transportation systems, including railways, roadways, aviation, and maritime networks. As transportation infrastructure becomes increasingly connected and reliant on digital technologies, the risk of cyber threats and attacks grows significantly (Perks et al., 2019)<br><br>

As a major transport authority, Transport for London (TfL) faces significant cybersecurity challenges due to its extensive use of digital technologies and interconnected systems (Matters, 2019). This literature review provides an academic-level overview of the current knowledge and existing literature on the topic of implementing cybersecurity measures in TfL. It aims to highlight similar and contrasting views from various scholarly sources to understand the complexities and challenges involved in securing local transportation systems.<br><br>
While I practise cybersecurity in my job role, I mostly deal with commercial customers, whose requirements are completely different as opposed to the public sector, specifically transportation. While the primary goals of cybersecurity remain the same and mainly revolve around addressing the “CIA triad”, the associated challenges, as well as potential threats differ significantly. While with commercial customers, a potential breach can cause a loss of revenue, as well as customers, the transportation sector also has responsibility for the passenger’s safety, which could potentially be impacted, if the IT systems were to be compromised or breached. These breaches can range from simple denial of service attacks, all the way to complete network outages, data leakage, as well as the potential for the attacker to take control over the systems altogether (Wilson, R., 2019).<br><br>

Existing literature<br><br>

The issue with researching the existing literature on cybersecurity is, that it becomes obsolete quickly. As new methods, tools, vulnerabilities, and frameworks are released, published journals or books cannot adapt to these changes quickly enough. Therefore, online sources such as magazines, blogs, or other types of media must be consulted to get an up-to-date understanding of the security landscape. However, such sources must still reference credible sources to be considered trustworthy.<br><br>

Despite the above limitations, there are many comprehensive, informative books available, that specifically discuss implementing cybersecurity in transportation systems. For example, the book titled Cybersecurity Challenges in the transportation sector by D'Souza et al. (2020) focuses on challenges faced by the transportation sector, as well as providing insight into vulnerabilities and threats specific to this sector, while emphasizing the importance of addressing these challenges.<br><br>

While D’Souza et al. focus on the challenges associated with the entire sector, Feng et al. (2020) focus on intelligent transportation systems, which are an essential part of modern transport networks, like TfL. While these resources are invaluable when it comes to understanding the challenges, it is also equally important to understand the consequences of different attacks, if the security infrastructure fails. In their book, Kremer et al. (2020) examine cybersecurity attacks on transportation infrastructure, including local transportation systems. They analyse different types of cyber incidents and their impacts on transportation networks, providing valuable insights for developing effective security measures.<br><br>

As society moves closer to automation, this poses additional security threats, mainly when it comes to autonomous driving in intelligent transportation systems. In this IEEE journal, Schmidt et al. (2019) talk about security challenges related specifically to autonomous driving, describing potential risks and vulnerabilities, while exploring techniques for securing such systems.<br><br>

While the above resources are mainly focused on the general transportation sector, the approach might be different, depending on the city. In their IEEE journal, Smith et al. (2020) focus on the collaborative efforts made by Transport for London in partnership with industry stakeholders to enhance their cybersecurity maturity.<br><br>

Since TfL keep passenger data and sensitive information, protecting it is paramount. Implementing measures like data encryption and access controls are vital components of TfL’s cybersecurity (Schmidt et al., 2019). Likewise, the passengers also need to be educated about potential cyber threats and safe digital practices when using TfL services, which enhances overall cybersecurity resilience (Sun et al., 2020).<br><br>

Overview of the challenges<br><br>

The implementation of cybersecurity tools and techniques in local transportation systems, including Transport for London (TfL), has been a growing concern in response to the increasing reliance on digital technologies and the evolving cyber threat landscape. The transportation sector, including TfL, faces unique cybersecurity challenges due to the integration of digital technologies, interconnected systems, and the growing use of intelligent transportation systems. The potential consequences of cyber-attacks on transportation infrastructure can disrupt services, compromise passenger safety, and lead to significant economic and social impacts (D'Souza et al., 2020).<br><br>

Kremer and Kanjo (2020) highlight the evolving cyber threat landscape, with attackers targeting transportation systems for various motives, including financial gain and ideological reasons. This increased exposure to cyber threats has severe implications, ranging from service disruptions to potential safety hazards. (D'Souza et al., 2020). Zhang et al. (2020) highlight the importance of continuous monitoring and threat intelligence sharing to detect and respond to cyber incidents promptly.<br><br>

Current knowledge emphasizes the importance of adopting a wide range of cybersecurity tools and techniques. From traditional measures like firewalls and encryption to advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning, TfL needs to keep up with evolving cyber threats and deploy effective cybersecurity solutions (Feng et al., 2020).<br><br>
Before such tools can be deployed, effective cybersecurity in local transportation systems requires comprehensive risk assessments and vulnerability analyses. Identifying potential threats, attack vectors, and vulnerabilities specific to TfL's infrastructure and operations is crucial for developing targeted cybersecurity strategies (Kremer & Kanjo, 2020).<br><br>
Human factors play a significant role in cybersecurity. Training TfL employees and staff about cybersecurity best practices, recognizing potential threats, and understanding the importance of reporting incidents are crucial for building a cyber-aware workforce (Sun et al., 2020).<br><br>

In addition to technological challenges, regulatory compliance also plays a vital role in shaping cybersecurity practices in local transportation systems. The EU Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive, 2023) and the ISO 27001 Information Security Management System provide frameworks for cybersecurity compliance (European Commission, 2021; ISO, 2013). For TfL, compliance with the UK Government's Cyber Essentials scheme and alignment with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, 2018) are crucial considerations in maintaining a robust cybersecurity posture (Transport for London, 2021).<br><br>

Similar and contrasting views on Cybersecurity Measures in Local Transportation Systems<br><br>

Traditional tools such as Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) have been widely regarded as essential for detecting and mitigating cyber threats (Schmidt et al., 2019; Smith & Kuilboer, 2020). They emphasize the importance of anomaly-based and signature-based detection systems to enhance TfL's cyber resilience.<br><br>

Some of the examples of views that were identical, or very similar across a wide variety of different sources include the approach to Collaboration and Policy Integration, where several studies emphasize the importance of collaboration between TfL and industry partners, as well as integrating cybersecurity into organizational policies and strategies. This collaborative approach enhances cybersecurity maturity and helps TfL to address cyber risks effectively (Smith & Kuilboer, 2020; Transport for London, 2021).<br><br>

Furthermore, when it comes to risk assessment and management, scholars advocate for the implementation of risk assessment and management practices in local transportation systems like TfL. Understanding potential vulnerabilities and threats enables organizations to prioritize resources and develop effective cybersecurity measures (D'Souza et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).<br><br>

Finally, the use of traditional security tools such as Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) are commonly recommended for local transportation systems. Anomaly-based and signature-based detection systems can enhance TfL's ability to detect and mitigate cyber threats (Schmidt et al., 2019; Smith & Kuilboer, 2020).<br><br>

While there is a consensus on the need for cybersecurity tools and techniques, scholars have varying perspectives on their effectiveness in local transportation systems. For example, Feng et al. (2020) present a contrasting view, suggesting that traditional approaches may not be sufficient to address the complexity of intelligent transportation systems. With the advent of smart and interconnected systems, the attack surface has expanded, requiring innovative techniques for effective defence.<br><br>
This exact document also describes leveraging machine learning algorithms for real-time threat detection as an alternative approach to tackle sophisticated cyber threats effectively. This perspective highlights the need for continuous advancements in cybersecurity technology to stay ahead of evolving threats.<br><br>

Despite many of the above technologies becoming more available, experts argue that budgetary constraints may hinder the implementation of comprehensive cybersecurity measures in local transportation systems like TfL. Limited funding might result in difficulties in acquiring the latest technologies and hiring specialized cybersecurity personnel (Sun et al., 2020).<br><br>

While businesses will try to minimise their costs by deploying simpler, traditional security products, which introduces a different issue altogether. While traditional cybersecurity tools like firewalls and antivirus software are essential, Feng et al argue that they might not be sufficient to protect against sophisticated cyber threats. They propose the adoption of advanced techniques like artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to bolster TfL's cybersecurity posture. TfL has made significant strides in enhancing its cybersecurity posture. The organization has integrated cybersecurity into its policies and strategies to ensure a comprehensive approach to cyber risk management (Transport for London, 2021)<br><br>

While Bhutta et al. (2020) highlight the need to address vulnerabilities in legacy systems, other perspectives may focus on modernizing and investing in new technologies to gradually phase out legacy infrastructure altogether. Such legacy systems may not have been designed with security as a primary consideration, making them susceptible to cyberattacks.<br><br>
 
As TfL continues to adopt new technologies to enhance operational efficiency, it must also address the security implications associated with legacy systems. While this may sound like the best solution, many businesses struggle to do so due to established and complex dependencies, as well as regulatory compliance and zero tolerance towards downtime, that could potentially be required during the migration of legacy systems.<br><br>

Conclusion<br><br>

Implementing cybersecurity tools and techniques in the local transportation system, especially in TfL, is an evolving and complex endeavour. Scholars emphasize the importance of addressing the rising threat landscape and vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure. Collaborative efforts with industry partners and experts are essential in strengthening TfL's cybersecurity posture. However, differing perspectives on the effectiveness of traditional tools versus innovative techniques create areas of debate, suggesting the need for a balanced approach. Addressing financial constraints and the complexities of intelligent transportation systems remain significant challenges. By acknowledging the similar and contrasting views, readers can shed some light on the complexities and challenges involved in securing local transportation systems effectively.<br><br>
