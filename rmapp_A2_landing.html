										<h2>Research Proposal Presentation Submission</h2>
									</header>
Project Topic<br><br>


The field of cybersecurity has emerged as one of the most rapidly expanding industries, with global spending forecasts predicting growth to over $190 billion in 2023 (Gartner, 2022). However, despite substantial investments in security, malicious actors continue finding new techniques to bypass defences, including the use of encryption to conceal exploits within network traffic (Morgan, 2021). Originally intended to protect data, encryption has ironically empowered attackers (Aldawood & Skinner, 2021). This presentation examines the rationale, technologies, and challenges surrounding traffic inspection systems designed to detect threats hidden in encrypted flows.<br><br>

First, we will briefly cover the history of encryption and inspection techniques as cybersecurity and surveillance concerns have evolved. Next, core challenges involving legality, performance impacts, trust management, and data leakage risks will be explored, noting industry-specific barriers in healthcare and finance. Configuration complexity and troubleshooting issues will also be highlighted.<br><br>

After defining the problem space, we will establish evaluative criteria, feasibility constraints, and goals for an experimental traffic inspection system. A review of current literature will inform hypotheses and methodology, focused on quantifying performance, detection rates, and application stability. The planned test environment, scenarios, data collection, and analytical approach will be detailed. Project outputs and limitations are also covered.<br><br>

Finally, a schedule of milestones is presented from initial setup through deployment, experimentation, analysis, and final reporting. In summary, this presentation aims to cover the concepts of encrypted traffic analysis, providing technical and empirical insights into this increasingly significant cybersecurity domain.<br><br>


Introduction<br><br>


The early era of cybersecurity focused on protecting standalone computers using antivirus software, firewalls, and access controls (Andress & Winterfeld, 2011). With the rise of computer networking and the internet in the 1990s, new threats like malware and hacking emerged, driving the adoption of intrusion detection systems and network access controls (Brungs & Jamieson, 2005), while encryption such as SSL/TLS became widely used to protect data in transit and at rest, while laws like HIPAA mandated data security (Romanosky, 2016).<br><br>

Today, cybersecurity is indispensable for government, military, and corporations. The ubiquity of mobile devices, cloud services, the Internet of Things, and encryption have transformed the threat landscape. Targeted decryption of traffic has become vital to detect malicious activity masquerading inside encrypted flows. Cybersecurity is now a multi-faceted discipline requiring a holistic blend of technologies, procedures, and law. Continuous capability development is crucial as cyber risks evolve in today's hyperconnected world.<br><br>
The Research Problem<br><br>


Modern enterprises are being confronted by many challenges, including phishing attacks, ransomware, data breaches, insecure cloud usage, supply chain risks, and inadequate employee training (Lee et al., 2022). While businesses now operate in a highly interconnected world, they often lack comprehensive protections, leaving them continuously vulnerable to financially motivated threat actors and state-sponsored groups. Ongoing investment in multi-layered cyber defences and resilience measures is essential.<br><br>

Companies increasingly aim to achieve both strong security and a positive user experience, but these goals can conflict (Garba et al., 2017). Excessive security controls like complex passwords, multi-factor authentication, and restrictive access create friction for users, reducing productivity and satisfaction (Mansfield-Devine, 2021). However, prioritizing usability over security heightens the risks of data breaches and other incidents (Fernandes et al., 2022). Nowadays effective modern security requires user-centric design and cross-team collaboration to develop solutions that are both secure and minimally burdensome for employees and customers.<br><br>

Here comes the issue, the encryption that was originally developed to protect users’ data against hackers is now being used by hackers as it allows them to conceal malware downloads and command-and-control communication within encrypted network traffic flows. This prevents traditional network security tools like firewalls and intrusion detection systems from inspecting content and identifying malicious activity (Aldawood & Skinner, 2021). <br><br>

SSL/TLS inspection enables decrypting and analysing encrypted flows like HTTPS to detect malicious activity that would otherwise be concealed (Ranum, 2017). Next-gen firewalls can be configured with decryption certificates and rules to selectively decrypt suspicious traffic (Conti et al., 2020). Machine learning and sandboxing inspect decrypted content for threats like malware and data exfiltration (Qabajeh et al., 2018).<br><br>
However, conducting traffic decryption and inspection on modern firewall platforms can have significant performance implications.<br><br>
 The additional cryptographic and processing overhead required for decryption and inspection can reduce network throughput and increase latency (Ranum, 2017).<br><br>

According to vendor benchmarks and academic studies, enabling decryption on firewalls can reduce max throughput by 20-50%, with higher impacts on lower-end models. The performance hit depends on traffic patterns - more small packets and SSL/TLS sessions negatively affect processing capacity (Porter, 2006).<br><br>

But how accurate are these numbers in the first place? Looking at benchmarks of several leading firewall vendors show the average throughput reduction by almost 80%, compared to 20-50.<br><br>

Furthermore, there are a few key challenges when implementing traffic decryption in highly regulated industries like healthcare and finance.<br><br>
These include privacy concerns, where traffic decryption violates compliance regulations like HIPAA in healthcare if it reveals protected health information (Miller et al., 2018). Performance is also critical, as decryption can disrupt time-sensitive applications such as stock trading (Mansfield-Devine, 2021), while breaking applications that rely on end-to-end encryption altogether (Kumara et al., 2022).<br><br>


Aims and Objectives<br><br>


Success criteria and the objectives I will try to achieve as part of this project can be defined in the following ways:<br><br>
•	Finding out how performance is impacted by enabling TLS decryption, compared to publicly stated numbers by multiple vendors.<br>
•	Finding out how important it is to enable decryption in the first place by looking at data consisting of well-known attacks, affecting businesses on a daily basis. By seeing how most of these exploits work, we can calculate the probability of the attack occurring, as well as the adjusted probability of the attack not being detected when transmitted in encrypted packets.<br>
•	Finding out the optimal reward/risk ratio between selectively decrypting certain applications, while allowing others through encrypted, based on reputation, trust, as well as the probability of the attack occurring within the specified application.<br><br>


Existing Literature and Perception regarding traffic inspection<br><br>


Some of the literature that proved invaluable in showcasing the relevance of the topic to the academic community, as well as the public, include:<br><br>

•	Ranum (2017) provides a comprehensive overview of traffic decryption and analysis solutions for encrypted threats, covering techniques like selective decryption, TLS proxies, out-of-band decryption, certificate manipulation and external inspection systems. Challenges such as performance, trust stores and private key management are examined.<br><br>

•	Garfinkel & Harris (2013) evaluated encrypted traffic analysis and interception approaches using TLS proxies, VPN concentrators and malware analysis sandboxes. They outline trade-offs between security and privacy goals.<br><br>

•	Conti et al. (2020) assess side-channel risks of TLS inspection including fingerprinting inspected connections via timing analysis and machine learning. Defences such as session padding are also examined.<br><br>

Overall, the literature covers a spectrum of decryption methods, analytic techniques, use cases and challenges that inform optimal strategies for balancing security, privacy, and performance.<br><br>

It is also equally important to understand the percentage of businesses currently deploying technologies that decrypt traffic. <br><br>

For example, a 2021 survey by Enterprise Management Associates found that among organizations running next-gen firewalls, 61% had implemented SSL/TLS decryption capabilities (Mierke, 2021). This is higher than the result of the global survey by Cybersecurity Insiders, where around 55% of organizations currently decrypt at least a portion of their SSL/TLS traffic for inspection purposes (Pescatore, 2019). There is an additional report conducted by Enterprise Strategy Group in 2021, where the number was much lower, only around 23% decrypt most of the encrypted traffic (Conner, 2021).<br><br>

So based on these industry surveys and reports over the past few years, it appears approximately 50-60% of enterprise organizations likely utilize some level of traffic decryption on their firewalls today. But rates of comprehensive decryption across all network traffic still appear relatively low.<br><br>

Furthermore, 50-60% is a very low number, leaving almost half the businesses potentially vulnerable to threats hidden in encrypted traffic, hence justifying the need for this project in the first place to potentially showcase additional benefits.<br><br>


Methodology <br><br>


In order to minimise the cost of the project, as well as maximise the ease of use and security, an isolated environment with no access to the internet will be deployed in order to test the functionality.<br><br>

Firstly, an expectation will be defined, consisting of published readings and references, followed by the actual results that will be gathered during the project.<br><br>

In terms of resources, the following will be required:<br><br>
•	Hardware, that will be required to run the virtual machines, as well as the actual physical firewalls handling the decryption.<br>
•	Software, that will be responsible for orchestrating the virtual machines, providing the operating system, as well as other services such as certificate handling and reporting.<br>
•	Both components need to work together and be easily accessible and manageable, therefore, the right environment for this project will be critical.<br>
•	Finally, the testing methodology that will be used to analyse whether the project was successful.<br><br>

For now, there are four scenarios that the project will be tested on:<br><br>
•	The ability to detect threats in non-encrypted traffic.<br>
•	The ability to detect threats in encrypted traffic with no decryption.<br>
•	The ability to detect threats in encrypted traffic with decryption.<br>
•	The ability to detect threats in encrypted traffic with selective decryption.<br><br>

The above scenarios will also need to be tested with different variables in mind, such as average packet sizes, applications used as well as other inspection features being enabled.<br><br>

Logs will be gathered throughout the entire project to determine the accuracy of the results, as well as to provide evidence. Once the logs and reports are available at the end of the project, these will be analysed and turned into an easily readable format, such as tables, graphs, and other types of reports.<br><br>


Additional considerations and limitations<br><br>


Risk Assessment<br><br>

A risk assessment will be limited, but still required, and will mainly cover scenarios where any potential threats will be spread throughout the internal network belonging to me. <br><br>

Ethical Impact<br><br>

This project aims to provide the reader with the information they need to benchmark the accuracy of publicly available documents from various vendors, as well as to explain the technology in more detail, including its strengths, as well as ways that attackers can use these technologies to hide their attempts.<br><br>

For the purposes of this project, the hardware, software, as well as other components, will be obtained from reputable sources with permission to be used as part of the project. Furthermore, the testing will only be done on a private network belonging to me, with no access to the internet, or anyone else’s data. All the hardware and software will also be obtained with a required license, instead of downloading it from questionable sources.<br><br>


Timeline of proposed activities and associated artefacts<br><br>


Depending on the final duration, as well as deadlines associated with the final project, here are the percentages corresponding to individual activities forming the final project:<br><br>
•	Planning the project and provisioning of resources, including the purchase of any required hardware and software<br>
o	Artefacts: List of inventories<br>
o	Time: 10% of the project<br><br>
•	Once the resources are ready, the design of the testing environment will be required, making sure that any limitations and requirements are captured before the implementation.<br>
o	Artefacts: Network Diagram, Configuration Summary<br>
o	Time: 7% of the project<br><br>
•	Implementation, including installation of hardware and software.<br>
o	Artefacts: Logs, Configuration Outputs<br>
o	Time: 3% of the project<br><br>
•	Validation and evaluation, testing individual scenarios pointed out in the methodology section of this document.<br>
o	Artefacts: Tables with expected and actual results, debug logs, reports<br>
o	Time: 45% of the project<br><br>
•	Report Generation includes the collection of results and other data, that will be analysed and presented in an easily readable format<br>
o	Artefacts: Final Report, Output Captures, Logs, Tables, Diagrams<br>
o	Time: 30% of the project<br><br>
•	Troubleshooting, not necessarily occurring at the end, but still needs to be accounted for<br>
o	Artefacts: Troubleshooting Logs<br>
o	Time: <5% of the project<br><br>


Summary <br><br>


As we reach the end of the project, I will be providing the final report, as well as a comprehensive list of findings, including reports, graphs, tables, and configuration outputs.<br><br>
At the end of the project, I am aiming to find out the deviation an administrator can expect when enabling decryption on firewall platforms from the published numbers, as well as the increase in risk to the business associated with not doing decryption at all.<br><br>
While the scope of this project was limited, it is possible to easily integrate the existing tests into different firewall platforms, including both hardware and software, with both dedicated and shared chips responsible for decryption.<br><br>
These tests would also be done on a limited number of platforms, and the numbers might differ heavily based on the input configuration, as well as environmental variables and metrics used.<br><br>
Finally, I would like to point out the relevance of this project once again, its use cases, as well as the importance of continuous investment and education in this topic to minimise the risk for businesses to get successfully attacked.<br><br>
