										<h2>Data Collection</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Assignment:<br><br>
Think about which data collection tool will be suitable for your area of investigation (in this module and/or in your Project module). How will you collect it and what analysis would you hope to perform? How will this answer your research question? This should also be included in the presentation of your Project Proposal in Unit 10.<br><br>
Topic:<br><br>
Impact of enabling SSL Decryption and traffic inspection on the performance of modern firewall platforms<br><br>
Answer:<br><br>
Given the technical focus of evaluating decryption impacts on firewalls, quantified performance data would provide the most definitive insights to address the research question. As such, lab experiments manipulating decryption factors represent an ideal data collection tool (Kothari, 2004).<br><br>

A range of firewall models from different vendors can be purchased or temporarily leased for hands-on testing. By systematically enabling decryption with varying ciphers, policy scopes and network traffic mixes, the throughput and latency impact can be directly measured under controlled conditions (Creswell & Creswell, 2017).<br><br>

Carefully controlling test variables and collecting granular performance metrics like packets per second across numerous iterations will yield statistically valid results, suited for quantitative analysis like ANOVA tests (Kothari, 2004). Experiments determine cause-and-effect relationships between specific decryption configurations and quantified network performance.<br><br>

To complement lab testing, network simulations provide a scalable means to emulate complex real-world conditions difficult to replicate physically (Law, 2014). Traffic patterns, rule sets and decryption formats can be modeled based on field data to analyze performance under diverse scenarios. This affords reproducibility without disrupting production systems.<br><br>

Surveys and interviews with network security professionals can provide additional perspectives on decryption impacts observed during actual deployments (Adams & Lawrence, 2019). This field input lends practical context to balance the technical lab measurements. Qualitative data also reveals configuration challenges and bottlenecks influencing performance.<br><br>

Together these methods enable triangulated data gathering through hands-on experiments, simulations informed by field trends, and direct practitioner feedback. The mixed quantitative and qualitative analyses will offer a comprehensive empirical performance profile to guide adoption.<br><br>

										<h2>Wiki Activity: Questionnaires</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
Assignment:<br><br>
                    Find a questionnaire and critique the design, both the format and the questions used.<br><br>

Consider areas such as ‘why is this question included?’, ‘is the form of the question appropriate?’ etc. How can you improve the questionnaire?<br><br>
Answer:<br><br>
I have found SANS Institute’s “Are You practicing Safe Security?” cybersecurity awareness questionnaire for consumers (SANS, 2020), which employs simple, direct questions phrased in plain language. This supports accessibility for the general public, avoiding technical jargon. <br><br>

Using a mix of dichotomous yes/no and 5-point Likert scale questions allows capturing a range of behavioral responses beyond just binary.<br><br>

However, the yes/no format for questions like “Do you use different passwords for different accounts?” could be enhanced by providing frequency options such as “always”, “sometimes”, “rarely” to gather more nuanced data on people’s habits. This would provide greater context around adherence levels (Boynton & Greenhalgh, 2004).<br><br>

The security goal of each question is clear in assessing password usage, device locking, software updating, and backup practices. But the scope could be expanded to gather data on other areas like phishing and social engineering awareness, social media conduct, remote work and BYOD behaviors to enable a more holistic evaluation of cyber hygiene (Alotaibi et al., 2017).<br><br>

Adding demographic questions on age, education, occupation, technology experience and training would allow segmenting responses based on respondent characteristics. There is a major difference between the security hygiene practised by an educated security expert, as opposed to a high school student. This would better inform targeted awareness initiatives tailored to groups with poor hygiene (Parsons et al., 2014).<br><br>

The questionnaire length is reasonably concise at 12 core questions, supporting participation and minimising the risk of participants either ignoring the survey as it takes “too long”, or quickly finishing it without giving questions a second thought. A potential improvement is creating a question bank with rotating subsets to cover more ground while maintaining engagement.<br><br>

The introduction could provide more motivation by citing disturbing cybercrime statistics and urging thoughtful responses. Presenting overall scoring after completion motivates reflection and next steps to improve (Kirlappos & Sasse, 2014).<br><br>

Overall, the questionnaire effectively assesses key consumer security topics in plain language. But enhancements in contextual questions, expanded scope, demographics, scoring, and motivation elements would provide deeper insights to guide education programs aimed at better cyber hygiene.<br><br>
