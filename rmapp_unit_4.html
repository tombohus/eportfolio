											Assignment:<br><br>
Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion “but not the corresponding names” of some records.<br><br>

Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.<br><br>

Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?<br><br>

1.  If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?<br><br>
2.  Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?<br><br>
3.  Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?<br><br>
4.  Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?<br><br>	

                      Answer: <br><br>

1.  If Ricardo lacks authority over data access, he should not provide the restricted names to Beth despite her request, as this would constitute unauthorized disclosure of confidential information in violation of privacy regulations, ethical standards, and likely his employment agreement (El Emam et al., 2011). His role as records clerk is custodian, not access arbitrator. Releasing restricted data would betray public trust in the proper protection of sensitive information by government systems. It could set a precedent for inappropriate data sharing based solely on personal appeals instead of protocol.<br><br>
2.  If Ricardo can decide access, he faces a complex ethical balancing act between enabling beneficial research and safeguarding privacy rights (Mantelero, 2018). Any disclosure above the minimum necessary to achieve the study purpose would be unethical. Ricardo should consult legal counsel, perform a structured privacy impact assessment, and potentially undergo ethics board review to ensure anonymity mechanisms, informed consent processes, vulnerable group protections, data handling protocols, and opt-in requirements adequately limit risks and harms before approving release (Wright & Raab, 2012). Subject matter, historical data breaches, and reputation of the requestor are also relevant factors. Ultimately Ricardo must judge if societal benefits outweigh privacy costs with robust mitigations. His decision-making should be fully documented for accountability.<br><br>
3.  The Records department is entrusted as custodian of individuals’ data and must only allow access to protect rights (Custers et al., 2013). A privacy impact assessment can determine if contacting individuals is appropriate and under what terms - purpose specification, opt-in requirements, anonymity, data retention limits, withdrawal support. Explicit consent demonstrates respect for autonomy. Higher protection may be warranted for vulnerable groups like minors. The department must aim to fulfill its research facilitation role ethically with minimal harm.<br><br>
4.  With only one-third consenting, contacting more people against their wishes would be unethical violation of refusal rights (El Emam et al., 2011). Beth should pursue an anonymized study or find additional willing participants through open recruitment. She could consult the department on appropriate communication to motivate higher response. But violating clearly denied consent breaches personal agency. Options that ignore participants’ choices are not ethically valid.<br><br>

										<h2>Research Proposal Review</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Assignment<br><br>
										Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:<br><br>

•  Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?<br>
•  Which data collection methods would you consider using?<br><br>
Note that you may find that you could be using a mixture of both the research methods and the data collection methods. These considerations should be included in your presentation of the Project Proposal in Unit 10.<br><br>
Answer:<br><br>
A comprehensive project to test TLS decryption throughput on firewalls would benefit from a mixed methods approach utilising multiple research techniques, such as experiments in a controlled lab environment, that would allow precise manipulation of decryption settings and network conditions to directly measure impacts on throughput. Experiments determine cause/effect relationships and produce quantitative performance benchmarks (Kothari, 2004).<br><br>
Network simulations could recreate complex real-world topologies and workloads. This provides a risk-free means to thoroughly evaluate how various factors like traffic types, rule sets, and specific firewall models influence throughput under load. Simulations yield reproducible results by isolating variables (Law, 2014). The requirement to utilise this kind of test would require a “testbed” solution for testing, which should be reliable, consistent as well as easily modifiable depending on the desired output.<br><br>
Surveys of IT professionals complement lab tests with perspectives from actual decryption deployments at scale. Surveys reveal throughput overheads perceived by practitioners across diverse industries and firewall brands. The aggregated trends add realism and field context (Rowley, 2014). However, I do not think I would be able to gather data at the same scale that I require, due to the limited outreach and reputation this project would have on the community. While the topic itself is important, the testing is being conducted by an individual, rather than a testing agency or corporation, that would have significant funding available.<br><br>
In-depth interviews with firewall vendors, decryption experts and users provide qualitative insights into configuration challenges, bottlenecks, and design considerations that affect throughput. Interviews add technologist perspectives and operational nuance (Adams, 2015). While I would not be able to interview several vendors due to the limited public information available on this topic, I would be able to reach out to the engineering department of one of the vendors, which would allow me to interview product managers, as well as engineers involved in configuration, maintenance, as well as troubleshooting of TLS Decryption.<br><br>
An ethnographic study within a company using decryption could uncover usability issues impacting throughput, by directly observing employees’ experiences. Ethnography reveals human and cultural factors (LeCompte & Schensul, 2010). This approach also seems more likely, due to the ease of distributing such surveys. It could easily be shared on social media platforms, such as LinkedIn and Facebook, however, with the added risks of individuals not taking the survey seriously, providing incorrect information on purpose, or not having enough experience to make an informed decision.<br><br>
Together these methods enable thorough, triangulated analysis of the complex decryption throughput issue from technical, empirical, quantitative, qualitative, academic and industry perspectives. While Interviews, studies, and surveys would allow me to gather intelligence from other sources and experts, simulations, observations and experiments would be my preferred choice of research methods, due to its lack of reliance on actively engaging other people as part of my project, as well as it’s accuracy, when properly references.<br><br>
This simulation study to determine TLS decryption throughput on firewalls would align with a conclusive research design, for the following reasons:<br>
Conclusive designs provide information that helps determine, evaluate and select the optimal course of action (Malhotra & Birks, 2007). Simulating decryption scenarios aims to quantify throughput capabilities to guide deployment decisions definitively.<br><br>
Exploratory research tackles problems where the subject is new or ambiguous. Existing studies have already explored decryption performance generally (Ranum, 2017). Simulation offers a way to build on prior knowledge with concrete measurements.<br><br>
Simulations allow full control to systematically manipulate variables and precisely measure outcomes (Law, 2014). This level of clarity suits a conclusive design focused on definitive results to aid decisions, rather than initial exploration.<br><br>
Conclusive designs leverage large, representative samples whereas exploratory approaches often use small samples (Malhotra & Birks, 2007). Simulations can model large networks and workloads for realism.<br><br>
In summary, a simulation to determine firewall decryption throughput aligns with a conclusive design seeking measurable, definitive results to guide adoption, not an exploratory approach investigating a new area.<br><br>
