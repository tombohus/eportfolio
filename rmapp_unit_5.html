										<h2>Reflective Activity - Case Study: Cambridge Analytica</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Assignment:<br><br>
In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.<br><br>

Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.<br><br>

										<h2>Incident 1: Cambridge Analytica</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
What happened?<br><br>

The Cambridge Analytica scandal provides a cautionary case study on the potential for abuse when consent, transparency, and oversight are lacking around commercial use of user data gathered online. I will provide a comprehensive overview of how this scheme unfolded and the significant ethical concerns it raises.<br><br>

Cambridge Analytica sought to microtarget political ads using psychographic profiling of voters on an unprecedented scale.<br><br>


How it happened?<br><br>

To enable this, researcher Aleksandr Kogan designed a Facebook personality quiz app that extracted extensive profile information, not only from consenting app users, but also their unwitting friends (Rosenberg et al., 2018).<br><br>
By failing to confirm data practices with friends of users, Facebook's policies enabled mass collection of personal data without permission. Kogan then deceptively provided the data to Cambridge Analytica for commercial use, violating platform terms (Isaak & Hanna, 2018).<br><br>
With data on millions of people in hand, Cambridge Analytica combined it with voter records, online activity, and marketing data to algorithmically infer personalities and political leanings. <br><br>

Why it happened?<br><br>

Essentially, Cambridge Analytica stealthily mined and monetized people's data without consent on a vast scale. They then used it to develop psyops-like propaganda tactics undermining principles of fair and informed democratic processes. Users had no visibility into how their data was accessed, analyzed, or exploited. This enabled highly manipulative and potentially unethical customization of political messaging to influence voting behavior (Confessore, 2018).<br><br>

This massive breach of trust revealed glaring gaps around commercial data sharing and need for stringent safeguards on monetization of mined user information. Users must retain complete control over and visibility into how their data is used. Opaque and unaccountable weaponization of people's information for profit and persuasion should never recur.<br><br>

										<h2>Incident 2: Uber</h2>
									</header>
<p>
What happened?<br><br>

The LA Uber receipt scandal provides a concerning example of how user data collected for one purpose can be abused without oversight, raising legal, ethical and social impacts.<br><br>
The incident involved an Uber executive accessing and tracking the real-time location of a BuzzFeed reporter without consent using 'God View', an internal tool that shows car locations of users who take Uber rides (Heath, 2014).<br><br>

How it happened?<br><br>

The executive used rider data derived from surveys that collect pickup addresses solely for providing the service to improperly surveil the reporter's movements (King & Forder, 2016). This violated user expectations around how their data would be utilized.<br><br>

It demonstrated significant risks in allowing employees unchecked access to collected user data, which could enable unauthorized surveillance and monitoring without transparency or regard for privacy rights (Richards & King, 2014).<br><br>

This likely violated privacy laws against using personal information beyond stated purposes without permission. It risked eroding public trust in companies ethically safeguarding data (Heath, 2014).<br><br>

Professionally, it highlighted negligence by Uber in implementing appropriate data access controls, auditing, and staff protocols to prevent misuse. Strong accountability and codes of conduct around data practices are critical.v

In summary, this incident provided an alarming lesson in the potential for unethical exploitation of mined user data without oversight. It reinforced the need for stringent controls and governance preventing unauthorized access or secondary usage.<br><br>


Why it happened?<br><br>

The main reason why is not as clear as in some other case, however, it is assumed that these high profile customers were tracked to better learn their travel habits, as well as having the ability to deliver personalised advertisement to these users without their consent.

										<h2>Incident 3: Facebook</h2>
									</header>
<p>
What happened?<br><br>

In 2012, Facebook data scientists deliberately manipulated the News Feeds of over 600,000 users to alter the amount of positive and negative content shown, aiming to test emotional contagion effects without consent (Kramer et al., 2014).<br><br>

The study violated norms around voluntary informed consent and debriefing when experimenting on human subjects (King & Forder, 2016). The expansive manipulation of data potentially breached privacy laws on appropriate use of information.<br><br>

Socially, it eroded public trust in Facebook ethically safeguarding user data for academic purposes, not unauthorized mass experimentation. The risk of emotional harm from the negativity biasing was also concerning (Kramer et al., 2014).<br><br>

Professionally, the lack of an IRB ethics review and oversight framework fell short of scientific standards. Stricter protocols regulating academic use of live user data were clearly needed (Meyer, 2014).<br><br>

In summary, this study exploited consent loopholes and lax oversight to conduct a deceptive mass experiment on Facebook users. It provided an alarming case study on the urgent need for transparency, consent enforcement, and ethical accountability in academic research on platforms.<br><br>

How it happened?<br><br>

By curating News Feeds to reduce positive or negative posts, without the userâ€™s prior consent.<br><br>

Why it happened?<br><br>

So the researchers could examine if emotions expressed in updates influenced the tone of recipients' subsequent posts. This massive experiment on unsuspecting users raised major ethical issues.
