										<h2>Discussion Topic - Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct</h2>
									</header>
									Pick a case study from the examples provided by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).<br><br>

Review the application of the ethics code to the situation described and highlight the impact on any relevant legal (jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional) and social issues, as well as on the professionalism of the computing professionals involved. You should provide comparisons to the British Computer Society (BCS) Code of Conduct.<br><br>


You should demonstrate that you understand the topic covered and ensure you use references to academic literature (including journals, books, and reports). This activity will provide evidence of your personal growth and your summary post is required in your e-portfolio.<br><br>

Your initial posting should respond to the question and be at least 200 words long. Your initial post should be labelled "initial post".

										<h2>Chosen Case Study: Abusive Workplace Behaviour</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
Diane recently started a new industry research job, joining the interactive technologies team. In graduate school, her advisor had collaborated with several members of the team on a number of research projects, involving and highlighting Diane’s contributions whenever possible. The team had been impressed by Diane’s work and recruited her as she was approaching graduation.<br><br>

Max, the team’s technical leader had built a reputation as a brilliant yet mercurial expert in augmented reality. His team’s contributions were highly cited within the field, with Max typically claiming primary authorship as the team leader. Their work was also highlighted frequently in popular press, always with quotes only from Max. Despite the team’s repeated successes, Max would erupt with verbal and personal attacks for even minor mistakes. He would yell at the person and berate them in internal chat forums. On multiple occasions, women team members have found their names removed from journal manuscript submissions as punishment.<br><br>

Diane soon found herself the target of one of Max’s tirades when she committed a code update that introduced a timing glitch in the prototype shortly before a live demo. Infuriated, Max refused to allow Diane to join the team on stage. Feeling Max’s reaction was unprofessional and abusive, Diane approached the team’s manager, Jean. Jean agreed that the experience was unpleasant, but that was the price to pay for working in an intense, industry-leading team. Jean’s advice to Diane was to “Grow up and get over it.”

										<h2>Initial Post: Case Study - Abusive Workplace Behaviour</h2>
									</header>
<p>
Diane joins an augmented reality research team led by Max, who has a reputation for brilliant but abusive behaviour. Max verbally attacks team members over minor issues and has removed women's names from publications. When Diane raises concerns after Max lashes out at her, manager Jean dismisses the unprofessional conduct as the price of working on a top team. Despite Max's mistreatment of women colleagues, Jean tells Diane to accept the environment.<br><br>
This case appears to reveal violations of both the BCS and ACM ethical codes:<br><br>
BCS Code breaches:<br>
Max's verbal abuse contravenes respect and consideration principles (BCS, 2018). His conduct perpetuates technology's culture of incivility (Fiesler et al., 2021). Furthermore, misattributing authorship is an abuse of power (BCS, 2018) that constitutes scientific misconduct (Resnik et al., 2015). Finally, Jean fails to address unethical behaviour, violating management's responsibilities (Johnson, 2003). Her dismissal of concerns perpetuates exclusion, conflicting with BCS inclusion values (BCS, 2018).<br><br>
ACM Code breaches:<br>
Max's bullying contradicts ACM's prohibition of harassment and hostile behaviour (ACM, 2018). His actions foster an intimidating climate that diminishes psychological safety (Jagsi et al., 2021). In addition, his authorship denial violates ACM's honesty standard (ACM, 2018). It reflects the marginalization women face in computing fields (Wachter-Boettcher, 2017). Jean is complicit by not responding appropriately to the ethical issues raised (ACM, 2018).<br><br>
In summary, this environment enables repeat unethical acts, requiring accountability and restorative efforts to realign with professional conduct standards (BCS, 2018; ACM 2018).<br><br><br>
