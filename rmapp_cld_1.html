										<h2>Chosen Case Study: Abusive Workplace Behaviour</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
Diane recently started a new industry research job, joining the interactive technologies team. In graduate school, her advisor had collaborated with several members of the team on a number of research projects, involving and highlighting Diane’s contributions whenever possible. The team had been impressed by Diane’s work and recruited her as she was approaching graduation.<br><br>

Max, the team’s technical leader had built a reputation as a brilliant yet mercurial expert in augmented reality. His team’s contributions were highly cited within the field, with Max typically claiming primary authorship as the team leader. Their work was also highlighted frequently in popular press, always with quotes only from Max. Despite the team’s repeated successes, Max would erupt with verbal and personal attacks for even minor mistakes. He would yell at the person and berate them in internal chat forums. On multiple occasions, women team members have found their names removed from journal manuscript submissions as punishment.<br><br>

Diane soon found herself the target of one of Max’s tirades when she committed a code update that introduced a timing glitch in the prototype shortly before a live demo. Infuriated, Max refused to allow Diane to join the team on stage. Feeling Max’s reaction was unprofessional and abusive, Diane approached the team’s manager, Jean. Jean agreed that the experience was unpleasant, but that was the price to pay for working in an intense, industry-leading team. Jean’s advice to Diane was to “Grow up and get over it.”

										<h2>Initial Post: Case Study - Abusive Workplace Behaviour</h2>
									</header>
<p>
Diane joins an augmented reality research team led by Max, who has a reputation for brilliant but abusive behaviour. Max verbally attacks team members over minor issues and has removed women's names from publications. When Diane raises concerns after Max lashes out at her, manager Jean dismisses the unprofessional conduct as the price of working on a top team. Despite Max's mistreatment of women colleagues, Jean tells Diane to accept the environment.<br><br>
This case appears to reveal violations of both the BCS and ACM ethical codes:<br><br>
BCS Code breaches:<br>
Max's verbal abuse contravenes respect and consideration principles (BCS, 2018). His conduct perpetuates technology's culture of incivility (Fiesler et al., 2021). Furthermore, misattributing authorship is an abuse of power (BCS, 2018) that constitutes scientific misconduct (Resnik et al., 2015). Finally, Jean fails to address unethical behaviour, violating management's responsibilities (Johnson, 2003). Her dismissal of concerns perpetuates exclusion, conflicting with BCS inclusion values (BCS, 2018).<br><br>
ACM Code breaches:<br>
Max's bullying contradicts ACM's prohibition of harassment and hostile behaviour (ACM, 2018). His actions foster an intimidating climate that diminishes psychological safety (Jagsi et al., 2021). In addition, his authorship denial violates ACM's honesty standard (ACM, 2018). It reflects the marginalization women face in computing fields (Wachter-Boettcher, 2017). Jean is complicit by not responding appropriately to the ethical issues raised (ACM, 2018).<br><br>
In summary, this environment enables repeat unethical acts, requiring accountability and restorative efforts to realign with professional conduct standards (BCS, 2018; ACM 2018).<br><br><br>

										<h2>Peer Original Post 1: Laura Saxton</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
Regulations of scholastic organisations require the prevention or restriction of minors’ access to inappropriate content on the internet, comprising of “pictures, images, graphic image files that appeal to sex, nudity, or excretion” or content “that lacks serious literary, scientific, artistic, or political value” (NuEdSec, 2023). To aid in this endeavor, the “automated Internet content filter” (ACM, n.d.) Blocker Plus (BP) was designed to help US schools comply with CIPA (2019) regulations to safeguard children’s access to inappropriate information.<br><br>

BP, in an attempt to keep blacklisted topics current, implemented a machine learning (ML) model that was subsequently manipulated by online activists to blacklist content concerning “gay and lesbian marriage, vaccination, climate change, and other topics not covered by CIPA” (ACM, n.d). Though BP leadership received complaints of censorship overreach, ultimately the poisoned ML model was kept in operation as the “legal and business risk” (ACM, n.d.) was greater if reverting to an older system.<br><br>

This decision violates the BCS Code of Conduct (2022) in a few key ways. Firstly, discrimination against protected classes is prohibited. ML algorithms have a history of reinforcing societal prejudice that can have a detrimental impact on these groups (see Clausen et al., 2022; Guerrero-Solé et al., 2019; Lu & Qiu, 2022). Though the psycho-social developmental needs of children and young people necessitate the monitoring and parsing of developmentally appropriate content (Megele & Longfield, 2017), this should not supersede the ethical requirements of providing access to non-blacklisted, perhaps politically contentious content.<br><br>

The BCS code also clarifies the need to promote access to the benefits of IT for all sectors of society, and to avoid injury to protected individuals through negligent action (2022). BP leadership were not compliant in either aspect. By first neglecting to qualify the politically targeted nature of the ML poisoning, it is in violation of the first code; while failing to rectify the poisoned ML model to allow fair access to information violates the second (the notion of protected individual could be extended to group protection here (Cornell, 2022)).<br><br>

In order to be ethically compliant, BP should have reverted to the older, analog model of filtering until the ML model could be reinforced against outside abuse. Though doing so could cause BP to incur additional costs of labour and development, the onus of compliance should be the responsibility of the manufacturer (Schneier, 2021).<br><br>

Risks to legal compliance and business incentives are important factors in risk analysis, but should not outweigh the ethical requirements of applications to comply with equal access to all non-blacklisted content. Though BP does have the requirement to safeguard children’s access to inappropriate online content, this cannot override potential discrimination against protected classes and politically-charged content.<br><br><br>

										<h2>Peer Response 1: Laura Saxton</h2>

									<p>
Thank you Laura for your valuable insight into this topic. I agree Blocker Plus's actions appear ethically questionable, but I also think the situation requires careful analysis given the complex issues involved.<br><br>

The BCS Code of Conduct obliges technologists to avoid harm and unlawful discrimination through their work (BCS, 2022). However, BP also faced legal duties under CIPA to limit minors' access to obscene or harmful content (CIPA, 2000). While imperfect, algorithmic filtering may have been the only practical means to comply given BP's vast scale (Wagner et al, 2022). Reverting to manual review could enable unchecked access to inappropriate material. Nonetheless, BP should have done more to address the manipulated blacklist. Biased algorithms that restrict access to information on marginalized groups are concerning (Hao, 2019; Noble, 2018). However, technology can also provide developmentally suitable protections, if crafted transparently and inclusively (Livingstone et al, 2017, 252).<br><br>

By failing to rectify the tainted algorithm or consult impacted groups, BP violated the BCS Code's call for accountability, transparency and avoidance of negligent harm (BCS, 2022). But the law equally obliges proportionate protections for minors (Wagner et al, 2022, 5). BP must balance competing duties through ongoing improvements and human oversight.<br><br>

In summary, while content filtering raises serious ethical risks, BP acts within a complex legal and social context. A nuanced approach aligned with BCS values would combine lawful protections, anti-bias measures, transparency, expert guidance and user participation (BCS 2022; Schneier, 2021). Legal compliance cannot override all ethical concerns, but pragmatic solutions are required.<br><br><br>
