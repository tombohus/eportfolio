										<h2>Exercise 8.1B Solution</h2>

									<img src="8.1B - Exe.png">

									Notes:<br><br> The difference between the mean values lost on diet A as opposed to B is 1.6kg higher, meaning that diet A was much more successful. In addition, with the standard deviation also being lower for diet A, it is much more predictable as opposed to Diet B.

										<h2>Exercise 8.2B Solution</h2>

									Notes:<br><br> The measurements once again prove that Diet 1 is more successful, based on the performance affecting the first quartile, as well as the third quartile. The higher IQR for Group B tells us that this diet is much more unpredictable, as there is a wider spread of values between Q1 and Q3.

									Notes: <br><br>While there are no conclusive results in this, we were able to find that amongs Area B, more people have a preference for a certain option, either A or B, compared to Area A. However, the majority will still prefer a brand outside of options A and B.

										<h2>Exercise 8.4G Solution</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="8.4G - Exe.png">

									Notes:<br><br>The sample mean numbers of impurity results were, respectively 8.15 and 8.54. The data therefore constitute significant evidence that the underlying mean number of impurities found was greater for Agent 2, by an estimated 8.54 - 8.15 = 0.39 more impurities per badge. The results suggest that Agent 1 should be preferred, as it contains fewer impurities on average, compared to Agent 2.<br><br>
									As with the design use case, a higher significance was proved by the lower one-tail p value (0.14), as opposed to its associated two-tail value of 0.27.

										<h2>Exercise 8.6C Solution</h2>
									</header>
									<img src="8.6C - Exe.png">

									Notes:<br><br> "Based on the scenario provided, I would use an independent samples t-test to compare the mean income between males and females.

The t-test is appropriate for comparing the means of two independent groups (males and females) and determining if there is a statistically significant difference between them (Kim, 2015). It aligns with the objective of testing whether male income exceeds female income."<br><br>		
"The results showed a statistically significant difference between the mean income for males (M=53.12) and females (M=44.42), , p=0.0016. The mean income for males exceeded that of females by $8.7.<br><br>

Since the p-value is less than 0.05, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude the population mean income for males is significantly higher than for females based on this sample.<br><br>

The key assumptions for valid interpretation are:<br><br>

•  Income data is normally distributed in each group<br>
•  Variances of the income data are equal<br>
•  Observations are independent<br>
•  Income is a continuous numeric variable<br><br>
•  These were validated through histograms, statistical normality and variance tests prior to applying the t-test. The findings support the claim that average male income exceeds female income."
