										<h2>Final Reflective Piece</h2>

									     What<br><br>

As part of the graded components of this module, I would like to present this final reflective piece, which summarizes the topics I have learned, as well as skills that I should improve. My reflection on the assessments is also covered here. This module covered a wide range of topics, including:<br><br>

•	The scientific method: A systematic approach to problem-solving that involves making observations, forming hypotheses, testing hypotheses, and drawing conclusions.<br>
o	I learned about the different steps in the scientific method, and how they can be used to answer research questions, the importance of objectivity and reproducibility in research, and the fact that the scientific method is not a linear process. It is an iterative process that involves making mistakes and learning from them.<br>
o	I also learned that it is important to be flexible when conducting research. The research design may need to be modified as the research progresses. It is also important to be aware of the limitations of research. No research is perfect, and there will always be some degree of uncertainty.<br><br>
•	Research strategies and designs: The different ways that research can be conducted, such as experimental research, correlational research, survey research, and qualitative research.<br>
o	I learned about the strengths and weaknesses of each research strategy and design, choosing the right research strategy and design for my specific research question.<br>
o	I also learned that there is no one-size-fits-all research strategy or design. The best approach will depend on the specific research question being asked, while it is also important to consider the ethical implications of each research strategy and design.<br><br>
•	Data collection and analysis: The process of gathering and interpreting information, such as through surveys, interviews, observations, and documents.<br>
o	I learned about the different methods of data collection and analysis, and how to choose the right methods for my specific research question. The importance of data cleaning and data management. Data collection and analysis can be a challenging process, but it is an essential part of research, and it is important to be aware of the potential biases that can occur in data collection and analysis.<br><br>
•	Professional ethics: The set of principles that guide the conduct of research, such as honesty, integrity, and respect for human subjects.<br>
o	I learned about the importance of ethical research practices, the ethical issues that can arise in research, such as informed consent, confidentiality, and plagiarism, and the importance of being aware of the ethical guidelines that apply to research.<br>
o	I also learned that it is important to be ethical in all aspects of research, from the design of the study to the publication of the results.<br><br>

This module incorporated many tasks, some of which proved challenging, or more difficult than predicted. Ranging from the assessments, all the way to the development plan, collaborative discussions and statistical exercises.<br><br>

So What<br><br>

I learned a lot from this module. I gained a deeper understanding of the scientific method and how it is used to conduct research. I also learned about the different research strategies and designs that can be used, as well as the different methods of data collection and analysis. I also learned about the importance of professional ethics in research. This knowledge and skills will be invaluable to me in my future research career.<br><br>

This module proved rather challenging for me personally, as it incorporated a lot of research, literature review and academic components, whereas, during the other modules, I could rely on “raw” technical knowledge, such as programming, system design and architecture. This could be observed during my first assessment, which was not successful at all. While trying to apply the same level of knowledge, or research that I would normally apply during other modules, it was not enough as this module required more research and critical analysis to form the literature review. However, the feedback was very helpful and it allowed me to better prepare for the second assessment, which was a research proposal presentation.<br><br>

In addition, I also allowed myself to have more time allocated to this task, while splitting it into manageable components, so they could be tackled one by one. Firstly, it was the actual research and evidence gathering, followed by the transcript, the presentation slides, and finally, the narration. As a result, my second assessment was much more successful, with even more valuable feedback provided, mainly around the presentation style and critical analysis, which I still consider one of my weak points and can be further observed as part of my skills matrix, action plan and SWOT analysis.<br><br>

The collaborative discussions were engaging and relevant, and interesting topics were covered. It was insightful to see other opinions from other students, including other countries and cultures.<br><br>

I’ve especially enjoyed the statistical component, as it resonates with my logical and analytical skills. I was definitely able to learn new formulas and Excel functions, that definitely prove useful in the real world. Some of the exercises were challenging, especially the final one in Unit 9.<br><br>

Here are some specific reflections on the module:<br><br>

•	The scientific method is a powerful tool for problem-solving. It has helped me to think more critically and logically about the world around me.<br>
•	The research is a valuable tool for making the world a better place. I am excited to use the knowledge and skills I have gained to conduct research that will make a positive impact on society, and I am particularly interested in the use of research methods to address social and environmental problems. I believe that research can be used to identify the root causes of these problems and to develop solutions that are effective and sustainable.<br>
•	I am also interested in the use of research methods to improve the lives of individuals and communities. I believe that research can be used to identify the needs of these groups and to develop interventions that can make a real difference.<br><br>

Now What<br><br>

I plan to continue learning about research methods and professional practice. I am interested in taking more advanced courses in these areas. I am also interested in getting involved in research projects. I was able to identify many weaknesses as part of this reflective piece, as well as the skills matrix, SWOT analysis and subsequently the action plan. I am planning on addressing many of these weaknesses soon, so I can work on improving them and learning from my mistakes, as well as utilising the skills learned during this valuable module.
