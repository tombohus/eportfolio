										<h2>Unit Reflective Activity</h2>
									</header>
									<p> Read Stahl et al (2016) and Bott (2018) Chapter 1.<br><br>

In the Stahl et al (2016) paper, the authors state that “many of the authors involved in researching the ethics of computing remain wedded to their disciplinary traditions and fail to provide actionable advice to relevant stakeholders.”<br><br>

Consider yourself as a relevant stakeholder, a Computing professional working for a company of your choice. Examine how one or more of the ethical issues mentioned affect your role in the company and what actions you would need to/can take. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature. Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help you evaluate the legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect computing professionals in industry.<br><br>

There is no strict word limit here but try to limit your submission to 2/3 pages (approximately 1000 words). You should include this in your e-portfolio, and you can submit it to your tutor for formative feedback. (If you wish to do that, please email them the link to the specific part of your GitHub e-portfolio.)

										<h2>Artefact</h2>
									</header>
									<pre> 
For this exercise, let us assume that I work as a cybersecurity consultant for a global networking company called Cisco. Cisco is not only responsible for hundreds of thousands, if not millions of customers, but also their global workforce of more than 75.000 employees. As a stakeholder within the business directly responsible for customer communication, several of the ethics would apply to me, starting with professionalism (Cisco, 2023).<br><br>
Professionalism is a key concern in the area of computing for several reasons:<br>br>
	• I am responsible for representing the company, even as an individual, I am responsible for ensuring customers’ requests, concerns, and issues are handled respectfully and effectively (Hart et al., 2022)
	• As a contributor, it is also my responsibility to inspire confidence in my abilities to deliver correct and relevant information, as well as support customers on a large-scale project, where punctuality, responsiveness, clear communication as well as accountability is critical (Raza et al., 2021)
	• Treating any data confidentially shared with me, making sure not to distribute it to unauthorized parties, ranging from employees not associated with a specific project, other customers, or specifically competition (Smith, 2005)
	• This concern is especially relevant as it references other concerns within the ethics framework, including trust, consent, and identity.
