										<h2>Unit Reflective Activity</h2>
									</header>
									<p> Read Stahl et al (2016) and Bott (2018) Chapter 1.<br><br>

In the Stahl et al (2016) paper, the authors state that “many of the authors involved in researching the ethics of computing remain wedded to their disciplinary traditions and fail to provide actionable advice to relevant stakeholders.”<br><br>

Consider yourself as a relevant stakeholder, a Computing professional working for a company of your choice. Examine how one or more of the ethical issues mentioned affect your role in the company and what actions you would need to/can take. You should justify your stance by also reviewing any papers included in this study or other relevant literature. Your discussion should also highlight the impact your actions would have on applicable legal, social and professional issues. Please note that there is no right or wrong answer here, this exercise is to help you evaluate the legal, social ethical and professional issues that affect computing professionals in industry.<br><br>

There is no strict word limit here but try to limit your submission to 2/3 pages (approximately 1000 words). You should include this in your e-portfolio, and you can submit it to your tutor for formative feedback. (If you wish to do that, please email them the link to the specific part of your GitHub e-portfolio.)

										<h2>Artefact</h2>
									</header>
									<p> 
For this exercise, let us assume that I work as a cybersecurity consultant for a global networking company called Cisco. Cisco is not only responsible for hundreds of thousands, if not millions of customers, but also their global workforce of more than 75.000 employees. As a stakeholder within the business directly responsible for customer communication, several of the ethics would apply to me, starting with professionalism (Cisco, 2023).<br><br>
Professionalism is a key concern in the area of computing for several reasons:<br><br>
	•  I am responsible for representing the company, even as an individual, I am responsible for ensuring customers’ requests, concerns, and issues are handled respectfully and effectively (Hart et al., 2022)<br>
	•  As a contributor, it is also my responsibility to inspire confidence in my abilities to deliver correct and relevant information, as well as support customers on a large-scale project, where punctuality, responsiveness, clear communication as well as accountability is critical (Raza et al., 2021)<br>
	•  Treating any data confidentially shared with me, making sure not to distribute it to unauthorized parties, ranging from employees not associated with a specific project, other customers, or specifically competition (Smith, 2005)<br>
	•  This concern is especially relevant as it references other concerns within the ethics framework, including trust, consent, and identity.<br><br>

While professionalism is an element being reflected directly during the interactions with the customer, it is also an area that cannot be measured as easily. While there are laws mandating certain concerns such as privacy and inclusivity, there are no well-defined laws when it comes to customer communication and professionalism. The way the person presents can be acceptable or unacceptable depending on the culture, field as well as a specific organization. This area is quite subjective (Jones, 2009).<br><br>
Generally speaking, highly specialized technical staff are often valued for expertise over soft skills, which makes it difficult to assess and enforce policies (Holiday, 2019). However, if professionalism is not enforced at all, this can cause significant damage to the organization, including financial and reputation loss, causing customers to abandon the business altogether (Topolski et al., 2022).<br><br>
Another major component that directly resonates with Cisco’s mission, as well as my own is inclusion. It is clearly defined in Cisco’s Code of Business Conduct, which points out the responsibilities expected from employees across the business. According to Cisco, an inclusive culture can be defined as an environment that promotes individual and team expression, innovation, and achievement (Cisco, 2021).<br><br>
There are several reasons why inclusion is a key ethical concern:<br>
	•  Exclusion and discrimination against groups create an insecure environment where vulnerabilities may be deliberately introduced (Garba et al., 2022)<br>
	•  Diverse teams enhance security by bringing broader perspectives that reduce blindspots (Scott-Hayward et al., 2018).<br>
	•  An inclusive culture fosters psychological safety to enable reporting of concerns without fear of retaliation (Barreno et al., 2010)<br><br>
Unlike professionalism, there are several UK laws in place preventing discrimination in the workplace, including The Equality Act 2010, which legally protects people from discrimination based on protected characteristics (Equality Act, 2010), The employment Relations Act 1999, which outlaws discrimination in employment on grounds of union membership or activities(Employment Relations Act, 1999), as well as The Agency Workers Regulations 2010, which provides agency workers with equal treatment after 12 weeks in a job (The Agency Workers Regulations, 2010). Many other laws apply to individual areas, as well as common issues associated with discrimination within the workplace.<br><br>
And finally, I would like to cover the ethical concern of privacy, which was already briefly described in the professionalism section. However, it is worth covering in more detail, especially in the area of security.<br><br>
Security work by nature requires gathering substantial personal information to perform functions like threat detection, vulnerability management, and incident response. This may include confidential data like financial records, medical information, emails, location history and browsing activity. While accessing such data may be technically required for security protection, it creates significant ethical obligations around responsible data handling and maintaining trust (ACM, 2018).<br><br>
If users' private information is improperly exposed or abused, it can lead to serious harm including identity theft, embarrassment, or discrimination. Users rely on security providers to treat their information ethically and keep it protected (Martin, 2018). Unfettered data collection without purpose limitation or adequate consent betrays that trust. Upholding
strict privacy protects individuals' dignity and autonomy against intrusive
surveillance and profiling (Solove, 2008).<br><br>
Similar to inclusion, there are actual laws in place to prevent the abuse of privacy, more notably The Data Protection Act 2018, which defines principles for handling personal data, its safe storage, retention, as well as removal (Data Protection Act 2018).<br><br>
To summarize, there are several ethical considerations involved in the area of cybersecurity that need to be carefully addressed by dedicated teams, as well as the overall company culture. Not adhering to these principles can have devastating consequences for businesses, including both reputational consequences such as loss of trust and customers, as well as financial consequences such as loss of revenue or fines.
