									<p> You should also take some time to consider your research proposal which could be based around the area you have chosen to investigate in your literature review or the topic of your capstone project (MSc students). Your outline of the proposal can be submitted for formative feedback in Unit 8 before final submission in Unit 10. Units 8 and 9 will be focussed on analysing data which, along with research methods, will also need to be considered in your presentation.

									<p>
										You have picked a topic from the Unit 1 list for the Literature Review which is a requirement of the summative.<br><br>
										Your formative appears to reflect a very focused topic aligned with your subject title, and you need to keep that focus for the actual Literature Review summative itself. Do not engage with lots of tangents in your discussion, keep your research targeted on a good cross-section of research resources that specifically connect to the focused topic you have chosen connected to your research question.<br><br>
										You discuss reflecting limitations in Literature and you do absolutely have to do this as part of the summative assignment, however avoid lots of sub-headers breaking the assignment down into too many sub-sections for discussion as you only have 2,000 words for the Literature Review. Some sub-headers for context are fine, however you will progress your ‘pros’ and ‘cons’ discussion naturally using varied literature to examine ‘fors’ and ‘againsts’ in the discussion itself.<br><br>
										By all means do have some form of discussion regarding identifying gaps in research that could be ‘filled’ in a Capstone project for example if this is something you would consider for your chosen subject moving forward, but consider how much word count to apply to this specifically given you only have 2,000 words in total. <br><br>

										<h2>Student Response</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										As per the feedback, I was able to reduce the number of sub-headings, but my research was still not deep enough – for the future, I will need to find more appropriate literature that correlates with my chosen topic, instead of just focusing on as many sources as possible to a limited extend. Any feedback is much appreciated!
