										<h2>Seminar Preparation</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											Assignment:<br><br>
In this seminar, we will be focusing on LO 3 “Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic.” One way this is done is by conducting a peer review of existing literature on a particular subject.<br><br>

In preparation for this week’s seminar, you will need to source at least 2 papers in a Computing field of your choice that utilise the two different types of research methods to achieve their goal/research aims. Now answer the following questions (please provide justifications for your answers) and be prepared to discuss them in the session:<br><br>

•  Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper. Are they in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic, contributing to the collective body of knowledge in this area?<br>
•  Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or question?<br>
•  In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question? (We will discuss this further in upcoming units.)<br>
•  Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?<br>
•  How would you enhance the work/paper?<br><br>
Answer: <br><br>
The first research paper I would like to review was written by S. Srinivasan in 2014. The paper's purpose is to compare public, private, and hybrid cloud security models, which aligns with my interest in evaluating platforms (Srinivasan, 2014). The qualitative analysis approach contributes useful perspectives to the cloud security knowledge base, even though most of the document covers information about the cloud computing area itself, rather than putting the emphasis on the security component.<br><br>
The conceptual methodology of analyzing academic literature and case studies is appropriate given the objective of synthesizing and comparing existing knowledge, not generating new data (Srinivasan, 2014). In addition, data collection and analysis methods match the qualitative approach. Literature analysis and conceptual comparison enable discussing security tradeoffs without requiring empirical data collection.<br><br>
The paper supports its claims well, grounding the analysis in cited literature and real-world examples. The comparisons are evidence-based, not speculative (Srinivasan, 2014). One enhancement would be interviewing cloud security experts to add practitioner insights and primary data to complement the literature analysis. Surveying users' perceptions could also inform the assessment. In addition, the scope of the existing case studies used as part of this research paper could be expanded to provide additional credibility.<br><br>
Overall, this is a well-executed conceptual study that provides a framework for holistically evaluating cloud security, supporting its conclusions with academic grounding. Augmenting with primary data could further strengthen the analysis.<br><br>

The purpose of the other paper I would like to comment on is to review prior research on educating and raising awareness regarding cybersecurity social engineering threats (Aldawood & Skinner, 2018). I find this topic very relevant based on my experience with security awareness training programs in companies I've worked at, so the focus aligns well with my professional interests and perspective. The analysis makes a useful contribution by consolidating findings on effective educational methods, an area lacking comprehensive analysis.
The methodology of a structured literature review is highly appropriate given the stated aim of synthesizing existing studies on cybersecurity education approaches (Aldawood & Skinner, 2018). A literature analysis enables systematically identifying, evaluating and integrating prior findings to determine consensus and gaps. This matches the research goal and provides a solid foundation.<br><br>

The data collection methodology involves a search across several literature databases using relevant keywords to identify papers on cybersecurity education. This ensures comprehensive coverage of academic insights on the topic. The authors analyze the collected studies using a coding methodology to extract key themes and conclusions. This qualitative approach aligns well given the nature of the problem and objective.<br><br>

The paper supports its conclusions and themes very well, grounding the analysis in specific findings from the reviewed papers. References are provided for all cited claims, rather than making unsupported generalizations. This builds credibility and trust in the derived conclusions.<br><br>

One way I would enhance this literature review is to augment it with primary data from cybersecurity educators through interviews or a survey. This could reveal additional insights on effective practices directly from practitioners to complement the academic perspectives. Including practitioner perspectives would provide more balance.<br><br>

To summarize, this is a very well-executed methodology matching the stated research purpose and questions. Supplementing with practitioner data could make it even more thorough and robust.<br><br>

										<h2>Research Proposal Review</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Assignment<br><br>
										Considering your thoughts on your chosen area of interest for your project:<br><br>

•  Which of the methods described in this week's reading would you think would suit your purpose?<br>
•  Which data collection methods would you consider using?<br><br>
Note that you may find that you could be using a mixture of both the research methods and the data collection methods. These considerations should be included in your presentation of the Project Proposal in Unit 10.<br><br>
Answer:<br><br>
A comprehensive project to test TLS decryption throughput on firewalls would benefit from a mixed methods approach utilising multiple research techniques, such as experiments in a controlled lab environment, that would allow precise manipulation of decryption settings and network conditions to directly measure impacts on throughput. Experiments determine cause/effect relationships and produce quantitative performance benchmarks (Kothari, 2004).<br><br>
Network simulations could recreate complex real-world topologies and workloads. This provides a risk-free means to thoroughly evaluate how various factors like traffic types, rule sets, and specific firewall models influence throughput under load. Simulations yield reproducible results by isolating variables (Law, 2014). The requirement to utilise this kind of test would require a “testbed” solution for testing, which should be reliable, consistent as well as easily modifiable depending on the desired output.<br><br>
Surveys of IT professionals complement lab tests with perspectives from actual decryption deployments at scale. Surveys reveal throughput overheads perceived by practitioners across diverse industries and firewall brands. The aggregated trends add realism and field context (Rowley, 2014). However, I do not think I would be able to gather data at the same scale that I require, due to the limited outreach and reputation this project would have on the community. While the topic itself is important, the testing is being conducted by an individual, rather than a testing agency or corporation, that would have significant funding available.<br><br>
In-depth interviews with firewall vendors, decryption experts and users provide qualitative insights into configuration challenges, bottlenecks, and design considerations that affect throughput. Interviews add technologist perspectives and operational nuance (Adams, 2015). While I would not be able to interview several vendors due to the limited public information available on this topic, I would be able to reach out to the engineering department of one of the vendors, which would allow me to interview product managers, as well as engineers involved in configuration, maintenance, as well as troubleshooting of TLS Decryption.<br><br>
An ethnographic study within a company using decryption could uncover usability issues impacting throughput, by directly observing employees’ experiences. Ethnography reveals human and cultural factors (LeCompte & Schensul, 2010). This approach also seems more likely, due to the ease of distributing such surveys. It could easily be shared on social media platforms, such as LinkedIn and Facebook, however, with the added risks of individuals not taking the survey seriously, providing incorrect information on purpose, or not having enough experience to make an informed decision.<br><br>
Together these methods enable thorough, triangulated analysis of the complex decryption throughput issue from technical, empirical, quantitative, qualitative, academic and industry perspectives. While Interviews, studies, and surveys would allow me to gather intelligence from other sources and experts, simulations, observations and experiments would be my preferred choice of research methods, due to its lack of reliance on actively engaging other people as part of my project, as well as it’s accuracy, when properly references.<br><br>
This simulation study to determine TLS decryption throughput on firewalls would align with a conclusive research design, for the following reasons:<br>
Conclusive designs provide information that helps determine, evaluate and select the optimal course of action (Malhotra & Birks, 2007). Simulating decryption scenarios aims to quantify throughput capabilities to guide deployment decisions definitively.<br><br>
Exploratory research tackles problems where the subject is new or ambiguous. Existing studies have already explored decryption performance generally (Ranum, 2017). Simulation offers a way to build on prior knowledge with concrete measurements.<br><br>
Simulations allow full control to systematically manipulate variables and precisely measure outcomes (Law, 2014). This level of clarity suits a conclusive design focused on definitive results to aid decisions, rather than initial exploration.<br><br>
Conclusive designs leverage large, representative samples whereas exploratory approaches often use small samples (Malhotra & Birks, 2007). Simulations can model large networks and workloads for realism.<br><br>
In summary, a simulation to determine firewall decryption throughput aligns with a conclusive design seeking measurable, definitive results to guide adoption, not an exploratory approach investigating a new area.<br><br>
