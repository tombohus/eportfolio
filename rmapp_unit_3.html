										<h2>Seminar Preparation</h2>
										<p>
											Assignment<br><br>
In this seminar, we will be focusing on LO 3 “Evaluate critically existing literature, research design and methodology for the chosen topic.” One way this is done is by conducting a peer review of existing literature on a particular subject.<br><br>

In preparation for this week’s seminar, you will need to source at least 2 papers in a Computing field of your choice that utilise the two different types of research methods to achieve their goal/research aims. Now answer the following questions (please provide justifications for your answers) and be prepared to discuss them in the session:<br><br>

•  Familiarise yourself with the purpose, problem, objective or research question of each paper. Are they in line with your experience or thoughts on the topic, contributing to the collective body of knowledge in this area?<br>
•  Is the research methodology utilised in each paper appropriate for the stated purpose or question?<br>
•  In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question? (We will discuss this further in upcoming units.)<br>
•  Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?<br>
•  How would you enhance the work/paper?<br><br>
Answer: <br><br>
The first research paper I would like to review was written by S. Srinivasan in 2014. The paper's purpose is to compare public, private, and hybrid cloud security models, which aligns with my interest in evaluating platforms (Srinivasan, 2014). The qualitative analysis approach contributes useful perspectives to the cloud security knowledge base, even though most of the document covers information about the cloud computing area itself, rather than putting the emphasis on the security component.<br><br>
The conceptual methodology of analyzing academic literature and case studies is appropriate given the objective of synthesizing and comparing existing knowledge, not generating new data (Srinivasan, 2014). In addition, data collection and analysis methods match the qualitative approach. Literature analysis and conceptual comparison enable discussing security tradeoffs without requiring empirical data collection.<br><br>
The paper supports its claims well, grounding the analysis in cited literature and real-world examples. The comparisons are evidence-based, not speculative (Srinivasan, 2014). One enhancement would be interviewing cloud security experts to add practitioner insights and primary data to complement the literature analysis. Surveying users' perceptions could also inform the assessment. In addition, the scope of the existing case studies used as part of this research paper could be expanded to provide additional credibility.<br><br>
Overall, this is a well-executed conceptual study that provides a framework for holistically evaluating cloud security, supporting its conclusions with academic grounding. Augmenting with primary data could further strengthen the analysis.<br><br>
