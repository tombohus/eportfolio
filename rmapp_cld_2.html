										<h2>Discussion Topic - Case Study: Accuracy of informationa</h2>
									</header>
Abi is a researcher at an institute and also a statistical programmer. Abi has received a project from a manufacturer to review the nutritional value of a new cereal, Whizzz. Having collected the necessary data, he now needs to perform the appropriate analyses and print the reports for him to send to the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the data Abi has collected seems to refute the claim that Whizzz is nutritious, and, in fact, they may indicate that Whizzz is harmful.<br><br>

Abi also realises that some other correlations could be performed that would cast Whizzz in a more favourable light. “After all,” he thinks, “I can use statistics to support either side of any issue.”<br><br>

Ethical Concerns<br><br>

•  Clearly, if Abi changed data values in this study he would be acting unethically. But is it any more ethical for him to suggest analysing correct data in a way that supports two or more different conclusions?<br>
•  Is Abi obligated to present both the positive and the negative analyses?<br>
•  Is Abi responsible for the use to which others put his program results?<br>
•  If Abi does put forward both sets of results to the manufacturer, he suspects that they will publicise only the positive ones. What other courses of action has he?<br><br>
You should also highlight legal, social and professional impacts of any choices made. Please note that there are no right or wrong answers here and you may introduce local, as well as international, legislature in your responses.<br><br>

<p>
While the data itself has integrity, selectively analyzing it to promote biased conclusions is questionable (Frankel & Siang, 1999). Abi should perform scientifically sound statistical tests aligned with the research aims, not just searches for correlations that forcibly favour the product. There are professional obligations to impartiality and transparency.<br><br>
Ideally, all significant results should be provided, whether positive or negative, providing disclaimers around limitations (Resnik, 2015). Omitting unfavourable findings violates research ethics and credibility. However, Abi may lack the negotiating power to enforce full disclosure.<br><br>
While Abi holds responsibility for honest data analysis, he holds limited control over usage by others (Groves, 2013). The manufacturer may selectively misrepresent findings in marketing, but Abi should actively discourage this through warnings and prohibiting selective quotations.<br><br>
Beyond providing complete results, Abi can refrain from putting his name on questionable interpretations, notify independent reviewers, or withdraw if ethics concerns are overruled (Frankel & Siang, 1999). But there are risks of retaliation or lost future work.<br><br>
Selective reporting to the public risks social harm if the cereal has undisclosed health detriments. However, premature publicity of incomplete findings may also unfairly damage the company before adequate study (Resnik, 2015).<br><br>
Ultimately, Abi must strive for impartiality while navigating complex competing pressures. Persistence, creativity and building alliances can aid in advocating for transparency and accountability when integrity is challenged (Groves, 2013).<br><br>

According to Schnackenberg and Tomlinson (2014), voluntarily disclosing information has lesser damage than another party discovering and disclosing the information and worse, potential cover-up. Abi has an ethical obligation to reveal the findings of his investigation to his stakeholders which may lead to a verification exercise of his findings. <br><br>

While the information may impact his organisation, they can reduce the damage by being open about the situation. The findings of the research that will be published may be subject to peer review. This may identify any information that may have been reported incorrectly or deliberately omitted. Ware (2008) states, “In our survey, however, the large majority of authors (around 90%) were clear that peer-reviewed had improved their own last published paper”.<br><br>

There is a possibility that the review of the findings by a peer may identify inconsistencies in the shared findings. Dacin et al.(2022) highlight that organisations may have to decide whether not disclosing specific findings is legal or not. Additionally, decisions must be made on whether, if legal, it is ethical. Some decisions may be legally correct but morally and ethically incorrect. If there are no legal requirements requiring the findings to be disclosed, in a case where this impacts human health, it is unethical not to make public the confirmed findings.<br><br>

Thank you for sharing this with us, Charles. You raise important points about transparency and peer review as ethical safeguards. I also believe the original case merits a deeper analysis of Abi's specific dilemmas and power limitations as an employee. A few additional perspectives:<br><br>

While voluntary disclosure is ideal, Abi may face binding non-disclosure agreements and lack whistleblower protections that prevent going public with results (Lubalin & Matheson, 1999). And without yet published findings, peer review opportunities are limited currently.<br><br>

Morally, Abi likely recognizes undisclosed health risks are unethical. But as an individual contractor, his ability to compel the powerful manufacturer toward transparency is constrained (Groves, 2013). Refusing participation or escalating through media might be needed options, accepting likely career consequences.<br><br>

The case reflects common systemic pressures researchers face - industry funding influence, misaligned incentives, confidentiality policies, and employment precarity (Resnik, 2015). Even with ethical awareness, resisting forces like client demands or potential retaliation requires exceptional personal sacrifice.<br><br>

True research integrity requires reforms addressing these embedded conflicts of interest and power imbalances hindering individual moral agency (Keith-Spiegel et al., 2006). While Abi should strive for disclosure, judgment should consider his work constraints. Structural change and collective action are also needed alongside ethical adherence to empower and shield researchers against undue influence.<br><br>

Abi is in a morally complex situation due to his research’s results challenging the nutritional value of Whizz cereal. The ethical concerns and possible courses of action, along with the legal, social, and professional impacts of those choices are as follows:<br><br>

Firstly, (CEPR, 2021) states that research should be done with integrity and transparency, therefore he should ensure integrity is achieved by presenting both the negative and positive results instead of changing data values so as to support his conclusions. Consequently, undermining ethical standards can tarnish Abi’s professional reputation and the manufacturer’s image (Turillli & Floridi, 2009).<br><br>

Since Abi suspects that the manufacturer might misuse the results to mislead the public, Abi can consider: collaborating with colleagues to discuss and resolve issues so as to enhance ethical studies (Sanjari, et al., 2014). Abi can also suggest an independent third party to review and validate the analysis and ensure that they follow his ethical practices (User research community, 2018). These actions could encourage product reformulation and healthier purchases (Grummon, et al., 2020).<br><br>

However, Abi should also apply the concept of moral intensity, like considering magnitude of consequences, - before making any decisions concerning the matter (Craft, 2012). For instance, if he publishes the methodology and findings openly to allow the public and other experts to evaluate the results independently, potential risks and challenges like breach of privacy and confidentiality, unprofessionalism, legal consequences, etc. - might follow (Turillli & Floridi, 2009) (ACM, 2018). Though this can be mitigated by anonymising, censoring or removing all sensitive data before publicizing it (User research community, 2018).<br><br>

Thank you for the thoughtful analysis, Beatrice. You raise important points on preserving research integrity through transparency and collaborating with colleagues. I agree validating results and anonymizing data help navigate dilemmas. A few additional perspectives to consider:<br><br>

While public disclosure may serve justice, Abi faces risks - breaching confidentiality agreements and non-retaliation laws often favor organizations over individual employees (Lubalin & Matheson, 1999). As a junior contractor, Abi has limited power to compel the manufacturer toward openness without sacrificing his career.<br><br>

The issues reflect systemic pressures - misaligned incentives, confidentiality policies, conflicts of interest - that constrain moral agency (Keith-Spiegel et al., 2006). Before judging Abi, prevailing structures that prevent acting on ethical convictions warrant examination.<br><br>
Reforms like whistleblower protections, worker organizing, independent ethics bodies, and public interest policies could help shift power imbalances undermining integrity (Resnik, 2015). But currently, resistance often demands exceptional personal sacrifice.<br><br>

While moral intensity and harm magnitude should guide Abi’s actions, the realities of his precarious position warrant empathy. Even well-intentioned individuals can falter against institutional forces. Systemic change along with moral courage is key to research ethics.<br><br>
